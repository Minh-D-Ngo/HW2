### Argument for Correctness

1. Initialization: We initialize an empty list `rotations` to store the rotated strings. The variable `n` stores the length of the input string `s`.

2. **Iteration**: We loop from `i = 1` to `i = n`. In each iteration, we create a rotated string by taking the substring of `s` starting from index `i` to the end and concatenating it with the substring of `s` from the start to index `i`. This ensures that every possible rotation is generated exactly once.

3. **Termination**: The loop runs `n` times, and after each iteration, a new rotated string is added to the list `rotations`. At the end of the loop, `rotations` contains all `n` unique rotations of the input string `s`.

4. **Output**: We join the list `rotations` into a single string separated by spaces, which is the expected output.

### Run-time Analysis

1. **String Length Calculation**: Calculating the length of the string takes \(O(1)\) time.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs \(n\) times, where \(n\) is the length of the string.

    - **String Slicing and Concatenation**: In each iteration, slicing and concatenation take \(O(n)\) time.
 
    - **Appending to List**: Appending a string to the list takes \(O(1)\) time.

So, the time complexity inside the loop is \(O(n)\).

3. **Joining Rotations**: Joining the list of `n` rotated strings into a single string takes \(O(n^2)\) time in the worst case.

The overall time complexity is \(O(n) \times n + O(n^2) = O(n^2)\).

This algorithm is both correct and efficient for generating all rotations of a given string.
